HTML/CSS/JavaScript Project - Rock Paper Scissors

1st Edition: 
Code for basic JavaScript Game - Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Utilizes variables, loops, functions and game logic
- Methods previously learned are also incorporated (ie. Math.random()
- Game display through console.log() - No HTML or CSS applied, no DOM manipulation
- Skills: Understanding errors, creating functions, problem solving methods (console.log),
using Chrome DevTools

2nd Edition:
Focus on DOM Manipulation and UI 
- Addition of HTML/CSS for static UI
- Re-structured JavaScript logic to include Event Listeners, DOM manipulation and interactive game elements
- Skills: EventListeners, arrow functions, calling functions, game logic, DOM manipulation, combining
CSS/JS to create interactive elements, switch statements, basic transition elements with QuerySelectors



Reflection for project:
- Creating HTML/CSS methods were a lot easier than previous due to practice
- More practice with arrow methods and breaking down programming logic into smaller functions
- Additional practice with event listeners for UI/interactive elements 
- Research and learn new ways to make code more efficient for future projects
